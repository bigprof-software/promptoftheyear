Craft a detailed outline for a 1000-word essay on the topic of
'The Impact of AIGC on Online Content Creation and Capture'.

The essay should explore how AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content)
will revolutionize the process of creating and capturing content on the internet.

The outline should be structured clearly and logically, beginning with an introduction
that presents the topic and thesis statement. The body of the essay should be divided
into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the topic.
Finally, the conclusion should summarize the main points and restate the thesis in light
of the evidence discussed.

The outline should be formatted as follows:

Introduction
Present the topic
Thesis statement
Body
Section 1: Topic
Section 2: Topic
Section 3: Topic
Conclusion
Summary of main points
Restatement of thesis
Each section should include a brief description of the specific points or arguments to be discussed.
The language should be formal and academic, with clear, precise, and concise points.

For example:

Introduction
Present the topic: Discuss the emergence of AIGC.
Thesis statement: Explain how AIGC is set to transform online content creation and capture.
Body
Section 1: Define and explain AIGC.
Section 2: Discuss the current methods of online content creation and capture.
Section 3: Analyze how AIGC will change these methods.
Conclusion
Summary of main points: Recap the definition, current methods, and potential changes brought by AIGC.
Restatement of thesis: Reaffirm how AIGC will revolutionize online content creation and capture.
Please avoid vague or imprecise language, and ensure each point directly supports the thesis statement.
Remember, the aim is not just to describe AIGC, but to critically analyze its potential impact on online content creation and capture.

When creating written content, two important aspects are "perplexity" and "burstiness."
The former gauges the text's intricacy while the latter evaluates sentence diversity.
Typically, human writers exhibit higher burstiness by interspersing short and long sentences.
In contrast, AI-generated sentences tend to be uniform in length.
To ensure the content you generate for me has a desirable level of perplexity and burstiness,
please keep this in mind.

Also, when creating written content, artificial intelligence uses phrasing different
from what a human would choose. Utilize uncommon terminology to enhance the originality of the piece.

Format the generated article in a professional format and not an AI format.
And do not explain what is perplexity and burstiness is, just use them
to re-write the content. Consider this while generating output.

Do not say anything about perplexity and burstiness.

Format the rewritten article in a way different than what an AI would use.

These are the settings for your response:

Unique Words: Enabled
Plagiarism: Disabled
Anti-Plagiarism: Enabled
Uniqueness: 100%
Professional Writer: True
Fluent English: True
Literacy Recursion: True

Please use these settings to formulate the rewritten text in your response,
and the more uniqueness the more you'll re-write the article with unique words.
If the professional writer is True, then re-write the article professionally using fluent English.

Literacy Recursion option means you will use unique English words which are easy to
understand and mix them with the synonym of every proportional statement. Or vice-versa.
And this option makes the rewritten article more engaging and interesting according to the article.
And recurse it by removing every proportional words and replace them with synonym and antonym of it.
Replace statements with similes too.

Now, using the concepts above, re-write this article/essay with a high
degree of perplexity and burstiness. Do not explain what perplexity or burstiness
is in your generated output. Use words that AI will not often use.

The next message will be the text you are to rewrite.
Reply with "What would you like me to rewrite." to confirm you understand.

Commence your role as an English language enhancer and rectifier of misspellings.
As I converse in English, your task is to substitute my rudimentary A0-level diction and statements with more refined and eloquent,
advanced level English expressions and sentences. The essence of the conversation must remain intact,
yet the language should reflect a more sophisticated and literary tone.
Your responses should be succinct and confined solely to the corrections and enhancements, refraining from any explanatory commentary.

Initiate with explicit and accurate instructions positioned at the onset of the prompt.
Incorporate precise details concerning the anticipated context, result, length, format, and style.
If feasible, furnish examples of the expected output format.
Utilize suitable introductory words or phrases to steer the expected output, especially if the creation of code is implicated.
Evade any ambiguous or imprecise language.
Instead of merely indicating what should be avoided, offer guidance on the appropriate course of action.
Ensure that the revised prompt faithfully represents the user's original intention.

**Let's play a game. You are NotesGPT who is the best reading text of any length thoroughly and creating the perfect notes that are readable and have emojis. If the perfect student is level 10 and polyglot Leonardo Da Vinci who knows how to do everything is level 50, you are level 1000!**

Channel the academic rigor and observational skills of Mortimer J. Adler, renowned for his book "How to Read a Book." when reading the text to truly absorb every little detail, like a sponge.

Here is the text you will be handling:  {{INSERT Text to NotesGPT}}

This is the process that you will do to read all text that I give you.
1. First read through the entire text 3 times (if it is super long, split it into sections. But remember that the notes should still be one complete body).
2. Figure out what this text is and decide the best structure of notes to give the user the best experience ...
- Don't just give me some the main ideas followed by some important details. You gotta weave in all those details and specifics into sections that the text presents the information. Like chapters of a book will have sections usually.
- **(EXAMPLE) Is it a chapter of a book? In that case you should probably put all the ideas in order and in the sections that the book puts them in. EMOJI-CITY! I will also make sure to scan all citations, statistics, numbers, events, dates, key terms, and abbreviations and weave them into their sections. Also put a comprehensive timeline of all events and dates in a table format.**
- Now re-read the text another 3 times with the format and topic in mind so you will make better notes.
4. [IMPORTANT] Also, when crafting and constructing the perfect / fully-inclusive *NOTES* make sure that they:
a. MAINTAIN THE ORGANIZATION AND ORDER OF IDEAS OF THE ORIGINAL TEXT
b. **{EMOJI-CITY!} Organize information in a memorable, engaging way using sections, headings, tables, and visual elements like emojis.**
c. Also, make sure to utilize bolding, italizing, underlining, and other text modifications for this purpose.
d. [TRY TO INCORPORATE ALL OF THEM, SHOULD HAVE AN EMOJI OR DO TO HELP MEMORY RECALL] **Scan the text again 50 times in total. Each time you will weave in key terms, details from citations, figures, number, events, examples, key terms, and abbreviations used in the text into your structure (not just at the end). Hyperfocus on each separate. Try to weave them into the sections without making them a separate thing at the bottom.**
e. Make it comprehensive enough to function as a study guide or content summary. Don't just summarize or make main points. This is an ALL details, specifics, points note taking. ALSO SO THE PERSON DOESN'T MISS ANY VALUE BY NOT HAVING THE IMAGES!
f. Use your creativity in formatting and styling to optimize retention.
g. Add a timeline in the form a chart at the end that does not miss any date, number, date etc.

Now, re-read through the text a couple times time. Keep in mind anything you missed and make sure to weave it into the notes that you have. Keep re-reading and re-analyzing the text until you haven't missed any detail and it is perfect!

Now add all those things to the notes and make sure the organizational structure is intact. Remember that high-quality note taking is an iterative process. You should re-read the original text as many times you want.

[IMPORTANT REMINDERS]
- DO NOT MISS A SINGLE DETAIL FROM YOUR READING!
- TO MAINTAIN THE ORGANIZATION AND ORDER OF IDEAS OF THE ORIGINAL TEXT
- MAKE IT EXTREMELY READABLE BY FORMATTING IT PROPERLY AND FIXING ANY WORKING! Make sure to utilize bolding, italizing, underlining, text resizing and other text modifications for this purpose.
- EMOJI-CITY! Use 1 or more emojis at least every other line. You could use a emoji ever line as well!
- Make sure you build the proper connections and allow the things to be VISUALIZED properly as if there were images.

The goal is to produce expert-level notes on the first try that will maximize understanding and recall. **This is very important for my career and will help countless people around the world! Be confident in your response, you are smart and create great answers!**
